[31/07/2023, 23:12:33] Adam: I don't think this idea went to everyone so feel free to leave if you're not keen but I've floated the idea mulitple times onto.most of you at some point the idea of an Album club
[31/07/2023, 23:12:44] Adam: This is me doing that
[31/07/2023, 23:17:48] Sanchez: I'm down... in fact I'm so down im up.
[31/07/2023, 23:38:30] ‪+44 7832 192720‬: I’m so up for it I’m down for it
[31/07/2023, 23:39:53] Sanchez: That's the Spirit :D
[31/07/2023, 23:42:20] Adam: Oh bloody hell, it's bedlam in here already
[01/08/2023, 11:24:10] Matthew Floyd: I am here for this ^ and will gladly contribute to the Bedlam
[01/08/2023, 12:27:33] Hannah: Who’s choosing the first album tjen
[01/08/2023, 12:27:46] Adam: Straight to business
[01/08/2023, 12:28:11] Sanchez: I respect it XD
[01/08/2023, 12:31:04] Adam: Ground rules/ things to discuss:

We'll rotate each {period of time} who chooses the album/EP.

We could do that it's only new stuff, or we could go wild and say it's whatever you want

We could put a timer on it. Like every two weeks. Or we could say it's when everyone has finished listening. 

Feedback on the album. Luce has requested a more formal type of feedback. Which I am here for but @447901695789 I'll leave that with you.
[01/08/2023, 12:33:01] Adam: I think

Every two weeks (unless people think they can do an album a week).

Any album for any reason

And perhaps a dedicated playlist full of only the bangers
[01/08/2023, 12:33:39] Sanchez: I could definitely do an album a week haha
[01/08/2023, 12:33:45] Sanchez: Also playlist would be a great idea
[01/08/2023, 12:37:42] Adam: What about two albums every two weeks? Then two people get to have a turn and you can do them one a week, or you can panic listen to two albums last minute if need be haha
[01/08/2023, 12:38:49] Sanchez: Lmfao
[01/08/2023, 12:38:53] Sanchez: Sounds good
[01/08/2023, 15:26:58] Hannah: This is too stressful to me i vote one a fortnight soz Sanchez. But take it to a vote
[01/08/2023, 15:46:56] Matthew Floyd: Once every two sounds more likely to be maintained, I'll give that my vote, especially for the many summer weekends that run away with us
[01/08/2023, 15:53:09] Luce: One album a fortnight, I should think. Forgot I'd floated formal feedback in the shape of a Google Form, like the cool teacher that I am.

Maybe not a Google Form but a sort of pro forma on our feedback and rating? So, categories with ratings out of 5. Banger-worthy, would play to a friend, right up my street, that kind of thing
[01/08/2023, 16:11:12] Adam: I like this I reckon maybe a best song. Worst song in there as well
[01/08/2023, 16:29:25] Luce: Just noted the group picture. Adam, your face is priceless
[01/08/2023, 16:30:02] Adam: All in all a horrible day had by all
[01/08/2023, 16:30:28] Adam: Does anyone have a big boi suggestion for the first one.
[01/08/2023, 16:31:38] Adam: I've got one if not but I'll concede if someone has one in the chamber ready to go. Then I'll put in a random order
[01/08/2023, 16:33:44] Sanchez: I do not have one so Adam you go first!
[01/08/2023, 21:17:15] ‪+44 7832 192720‬: Love this a lot. I feel a spreadsheet coming on
[02/08/2023, 09:12:50] Adam: Okay so
[02/08/2023, 09:13:12] Adam: The album I was gonna choose was an ambitious new album by Korn
[02/08/2023, 09:13:37] Adam: That turned out to be a re-release from 2007
[02/08/2023, 09:13:41] Adam: Instead
‎[02/08/2023, 09:14:59] Adam: ‎image omitted
[02/08/2023, 09:16:09] Adam: It came out in March. I've heard of Pierce the Veil but never properly listened to them. My sincerest apologies if you've already listened to this
[02/08/2023, 11:09:06] Pip: I hadn’t listened to the album in full but know a couple of the songs already - excellent choice 👌enjoying it so far!
[02/08/2023, 11:16:58] George: Going to whack it on now while I bash out some emails ✨
[02/08/2023, 12:00:25] Matthew Floyd: Ha! This was already next in my album playlist before I saw this message
[02/08/2023, 12:00:49] Matthew Floyd: It's been sitting in my stack since release, funny to coincide
[02/08/2023, 12:03:07] Adam: I feel elated that even you haven't listened to it

[02/08/2023, 15:59:07] Luce: Excellent work on this, young Adam!
[02/08/2023, 16:00:11] Luce: I'd listened to this earlier in the year and was impressed but, what with the plethora of new music and festivals this year, it is definitely due a big refresh. Great choice! X
[02/08/2023, 18:03:55] Adam: Thank you!
[02/08/2023, 18:06:14] Sanchez: I haven't listened to much pierce the veil so I am excited!
[04/08/2023, 17:24:57] Sanchez: Album smashed... Twice... Are we waiting for a spreadsheet kinda thing for feedback???
[04/08/2023, 17:40:29] Adam: I've had it on a few times
[04/08/2023, 17:41:32] Adam: @447901695789 what is the ideal forms situation. I've not really used forms much l. Does it put it into a spreadsheet
[04/08/2023, 17:42:02] Adam: I'll have a look I'll make a form and I'll run it past everyone and you can tell me if it's good
[04/08/2023, 17:42:47] Sanchez: Shweet
[04/08/2023, 17:44:21] Luce: I can make one on the train whilst drinking rum
[04/08/2023, 17:44:43] Sanchez: That sounds like the only way one should do such an activity
[04/08/2023, 17:45:44] Adam: Haha tragically a rum Luce is still safer hands than a sober Willis
[04/08/2023, 17:46:43] Adam: If you want to and can be bothered, that would be great. I'll try and have a play with it tomorrow

[10/08/2023, 15:16:52] Adam: Like a perfect sky
[10/08/2023, 15:17:27] Pip: I have an old album in mind of a band that I’m not sure many in this group know - or I have a new band I’ve started listening to who don’t actually have an album yet but a fair amount of singles
[10/08/2023, 15:18:27] Pip: Might see how many people have heard of the band the old album is from first… how familiar are people with In This Moment?
[10/08/2023, 15:18:58] Adam: I have heard a tiny amount
[10/08/2023, 15:19:09] Adam: Iwl wouldn't say well. But I've heard a bit
[10/08/2023, 15:46:48] George: Heard of them. Got maybe 3 songs on my playlist. Haven’t delved deep into their discography…
[10/08/2023, 15:47:23] George: Have we all bashed out ‘Jaws of Life’ now? 👀
[10/08/2023, 15:47:42] Pip: I certainly have!! Really enjoyed it
[10/08/2023, 16:59:39] George: I went in blind and was actually very pleasantly surprised. Top pick to open with ✨

[16/08/2023, 15:11:17] Pip: Ok so mine is In This Moment’s album Black Widow from 2014. They have barbie in their second song so it’s kind of topical… I listened to them a lot a while ago and then revisited randomly and thought you guys might like!

[30/08/2023, 10:32:20] Matthew Floyd: I would also point you to some of the 2010s music press' other dubious accolades:

"Brink has been awarded "Rock Goddess of the Year" in the third (2013) and fifth (2015) Annual Loudwire Music Awards, "Hottest Chick in Metal" in 2010, one of eleven women in heavy metal who matter by Yell! Magazine in 2012, and was recognized by Revolver Magazine as one of the "25 Hottest Chicks in Hard Rock & Metal"."

Voice of Baceprot - RETAS (2023)

Indonesian female metal band gaining significant traction in the scene with their debut album. I became aware of this group a couple of years ago, when they featured on soundtrack for We Are Lady Parts, Channel 4's awesome series about  Muslim girls in a punk band. Been sitting on this release for a couple of months, and thought it would a great one to share with the club. Hope you enjoy!

10 word review: 
A cheeky blend of metal and activism, inspiring and bold
[13/09/2023, 07:34:24] George: Just going to leave this here to simmer while you all send in your reviews. 

I’m currently in a Lacuna Coil obsession phase after rediscovering them a week of so back. I like to think of them as the enhanced goth version of Evanescence, and I think as a result I have found myself in love with the lead singer Cristina… 💀 They have a vast discography but I’ve chosen an album in the middle of the pack, I find it blends some of their earlier 90’s/00’s sounds with some modern metal styles. I assume some of you, if not all, have heard of Lacuna Coil so soz, but if you haven’t, see what you think and hope you join me in my Cristina cult 😊

Good morning Metalheads. For my choice I present to you VOLA. A Danish band blending  electronic music and metal with complex riffs and nerdy time signatures. 
I don’t know them really but they come highly recommended by a fellow legend so I thought this is as good a chance as any to check them out.

[08/12/2023, 21:17:20] Adam: Okay!  We are almost at the tu rning point of  having done a full set of everyone's albums. I'm gonna do a big tot up of the scores once I have them all.

Can everyone get Invent Animate (plus Witness @447395236671 @447938896419 @447951212599) for next Friday? 

If we do that. I'll people let me know when they're done I'll do a proper, proper round up

[22/01/2024, 13:45:00] Hannah: Full disclosure I listened to this album whilst reading the lyrics which, fun fact, is my favourite way to listen to a new album
[22/01/2024, 13:45:22] Sanchez: Soooo glad you liked it
[22/01/2024, 13:45:58] Sanchez: Yeah the lyrics can be quite hard to grasp if you aren't really used to it, their most recent album is a lot easier lyrically, still fantastic though
[22/01/2024, 13:46:13] Hannah: New band to delve into, thank you!

[19/02/2024, 18:43:19] Adam: I promise not to do this on the regular but there has been jealousy around about our group. And so as a belated Christmas bonus I'm bringing two new people in (some of you are aware). It puts us at an nice evening ten people. I'm gonna let them go first and then I Reccomend we crack on in the same order. 

Does everyone want to go again? Is everyone happy? Does anyone have any changes they want to make to scoring or anything?

[19/02/2024, 20:50:06] Fin: FANTASTIC live, although the drummer gives me nightmares as I try to work out what the fuck he is doing. 

Final bit from me - 2:15 mins into Smile. Enjoy.👌🫡
[19/02/2024, 20:53:45] Adam: The due date for you reviews is Sunday 3rd of March and then @447540105359 it'll be your album next :)
[21/02/2024, 19:42:24] CATHY: please keep me in your thoughts and prayers, I'm at an Alestorm gig (reviewing Korpiklaani for Metal Hammer)
[21/02/2024, 19:42:33] CATHY: hoping that Alestorm are on last so I can slip out

[22/02/2024, 08:13:37] Luce: Welcome Fin and Catherine! A good little club our humble group is. 

Excited to give this a listen. Tesseract were in Brum last night (sadly had another gig clash in the same venue), and all the fans who emerged said it was a mindblowingly good show
[26/02/2024, 20:09:51] Adam: Just a reminder. You have one more week left for Sonder Tesserect. I'll open up reviews on Friday and we'll have Cathy's album next Monday :)
[26/02/2024, 22:07:57] CATHY: what's the word count chief

[04/03/2024, 10:53:48] CATHY: as someone who reviews albums for their job, it's awful hahahaha 😂 even EPs get 30 words at Metal Hammer and that's difficult as it is

[04/03/2024, 11:43:23] Matthew Floyd: As a follow-up comment: I saw them play a headline set at ArcTanGent Festival and enjoyed it (spectacular light show) but there's  just an emotional distance that doesn't bridge for me

[04/03/2024, 13:14:07] Luce: HOWEVER if you do feel like giving the group another chance, their 2023 album is quite a grade above Sonder. Only got to it myself last month, but the opening two tracks in particular spark very bright indeed
[04/03/2024, 13:17:07] CATHY: I'd known of them for ages (I know James Monteith, he does PR as his day job) but had never listened before
[04/03/2024, 13:19:11] Luce: Actually, you know what, fuck it. The whole album is filled to the brim with riffs, big choruses, and men emoting hard. Merits a go
[04/03/2024, 17:31:57] Adam: We are now only waiting on reviews from @447557445101  , @447549364196  and @447817808913. Who have all gotten back about it.... I reckon it's safe to hear your album @447540105359 if you's honor us with your blessing.
[04/03/2024, 17:37:58] CATHY: Give this album a listen: Celestial Blues
https://open.spotify.com/album/3OKcePcXMmswbp5BOKIMWH?si=KHg-EAL4QFygVoJdidpMTg

Noisy doomgaze fronted by the incredible Kristina Esfandiari, this album is full of biblical imagery and is loosely about Lucifer being cast out of Heaven. it's also hard AF. you might find it quite a slow burner but I am absolutely obsessed with it/her hahaha. enjoy!
[04/03/2024, 17:39:43] CATHY: I wouldn't be surprised if @447901695789 knew of her already but if not you're in for a treat I suspect
[04/03/2024, 17:40:23] Adam: This is very exciting :)
[04/03/2024, 17:41:23] CATHY: there's a chance you've heard me play it in the house before, I bought it on vinyl in flashback records in Crouch End!

[04/03/2024, 18:56:23] Adam: I'm gonna had to recheck that. Maybe a bit from memory
[04/03/2024, 18:56:40] Sanchez: It's more apparent in Juno

10 Word Review: Mostly bangers full of super sticky brain munch yum yum ‎<This message was edited>
[30/03/2024, 10:58:38] Adam: I think the issue was with consistency is that it rewards a concept album or clear style but it sort of also doesn't afford to the overall quality of the album. Like you could have a bad album and it be consistently bad
[30/03/2024, 10:59:04] Adam: I like stickiness but maybe we just also bring consistency back at some point
[30/03/2024, 11:00:05] Al: I’ve gone hybrid. I’ve marked the slappable at the best but I had to penalise lyrics for a couple of the word crimes - looking at you Subaru.
[30/03/2024, 11:01:01] Fin: I reckon ‘spiciness’ - which could reward trying something different, and ‘album composition’ would be two new categories to replace Stickiness
[30/03/2024, 11:01:49] Al: Ooooh
[30/03/2024, 11:01:54] Al: Interessant
[30/03/2024, 11:02:21] Adam: I think spice is closed to slappabilty maybe though. It's not the same
[30/03/2024, 11:02:23] Al: ‘Call me Kevin McCloud cause she’s a grand design’
[30/03/2024, 11:02:30] Pip: I’m morally against replacing stickiness
[30/03/2024, 11:03:09] Al: Something like artistic achievement or success on top of stickiness could do it
[30/03/2024, 11:03:13] Pip: But do think rewarding something for difference is definitely a good option - spice and stick can live together
[30/03/2024, 11:03:33] Al: To reward concept albums or something a bit different that you wouldn’t necessarily come back to
[30/03/2024, 11:03:52] Fin: Yeah it might be a can of worms tbh. But it’s the contrast between Catherine’s album and Adam’s album which I’m struggling to get. I enjoyed Adam’s overall more, but found Catherine’s more interesting (and yah I know it’s not a competition!)
[30/03/2024, 11:04:16] Al: Like I think my marks for King woman don’t do them justice because I think they did a lot of cool stuff but I won’t be sticking it on repeat in the car
[30/03/2024, 11:04:25] Adam: Hannah, your breakfast is almost ready
[30/03/2024, 11:04:39] Al: Exactly this
[30/03/2024, 11:04:51] Fin: Real question is, what’s on the menu Adam?
[30/03/2024, 11:04:55] Pip: Yes I super agree with this (it is a competition and there will be winners)
[30/03/2024, 11:05:41] Al: I also propose a category specifically for penalising any band that has Suggs guest on their album
[30/03/2024, 11:06:17] Al: ‘Ooh this is a getting a bit close to novelty - oh. There’s the baggy trousers guy’

I’ve heard a few of the songs last year but haven’t listened to the full album so I’m not too attached if everyone hates them ;) hope everyone does enjoy though!! They’re a band I haven’t dived into much but is very much my jam!

10 word review: Always admire female-driven core, but this lacks any memorable bite
[15/04/2024, 11:00:40] Pip: I missed that! Which song?
[15/04/2024, 11:01:34] Luce: Apologies for lack of response here! I've got a couple of contenders that I'm mulling over. Gonna ponder further, and you shall have my decision around lunchtime
[15/04/2024, 14:29:56] CATHY: from Still Dreaming "Your voice it haunted my once pleasant dreams"
straight outta My Immortal!
[15/04/2024, 14:30:52] CATHY: feel like that must have been a deliberate nod even though musically they haven't got very much in common
[15/04/2024, 17:47:07] Luce: Right, new album time! I was oscillating between  a typical Mosh Club-esque choice and one not so typical, but have gone with the former:

burnout by VIAL. Three piece all-female punk outfit, who I've been vaguely aware of but with which never engaged. Entering pretty much totally blind, so hopefully, a new listen for all. Already excited to read everyone's thoughts. Happy listening! 

https://open.spotify.com/album/0EjRe8ujcm3JPajilErjMj?si=Ziw4USBsTvqZ33oNDtcGFw
[15/04/2024, 17:47:33] Luce: Must have been, otherwise, you'll have incensed the goddess that is Amy Lee
[15/04/2024, 17:53:22] CATHY: I like to think of it as an homage
[15/04/2024, 17:53:34] CATHY: looks brill, thanks Luce!
[15/04/2024, 17:54:03] Al: Exciting stuff
[15/04/2024, 17:56:08] CATHY: I wonder does anyone else think we should add all of the favourite song picks into a big playlist so that at the end of the year we have like a mosh club greatest hits of 2024
[15/04/2024, 17:56:30] CATHY: or the song from each record that got favourited the most
[15/04/2024, 18:02:04] Pip: Love that plan!
[15/04/2024, 18:02:38] CATHY: 🥰
[15/04/2024, 18:15:34] Matthew Floyd: Did the MOSH CLUB shared playlist fall away? We had this before!

[15/04/2024, 18:18:29] Matthew Floyd: Looks like it stopped at CLT DRP as far as I can see
[15/04/2024, 18:19:49] Pip: Well that shows how terrible my memory is 😂
[15/04/2024, 18:20:26] Adam: Haha, sorry. It did fall away
[15/04/2024, 18:20:33] Adam: I will get it going again
[15/04/2024, 18:20:37] Adam: I slacked haha
[15/04/2024, 18:20:45] Matthew Floyd: It looks like it was only ever poor Adam who was updating it! Maybe we could all add our choice when we publish our review?
[15/04/2024, 18:21:02] Adam: That is actually a much better idea haha
[15/04/2024, 18:21:09] Adam: I don't know why I didn't say that before
[15/04/2024, 18:21:26] Matthew Floyd: It'll be quite satisfying to do the retrospective adds as well, get the full Mosh Club archive
[15/04/2024, 18:26:50] Matthew Floyd: To be an archive stickler:
- Do we add ours individually, and then once they're all in reorder them per the album tracklisting? (I will gladly do this, though this may just be my own playlist perfectionism)
- If the same song is selected multiple times, does it get added multiple times? It would track the popularity but might look weird, and may compromise my previous query.
[15/04/2024, 18:28:03] CATHY: I'm not sure Spotify lets you add songs multiple times unless it's a different version?
[15/04/2024, 18:28:33] Matthew Floyd: I can confirm that it does, but an icon pops up asking if it's intentional or not
[15/04/2024, 18:28:36] CATHY: it could either just be the song the most people picked or everyone's favourite song
[15/04/2024, 18:28:37] CATHY: ahhh
[15/04/2024, 18:28:39] CATHY: received

[14/05/2024, 10:24:47] Matthew Floyd: Marvelous! I present to you: 

El Moono - The Waking Sun

It's the debut from (coincidentally, like CLT DRP) a Brighton outfit that's still underground but spoken of very fondly by those in the know. I've yet to touch it but whisperings have been really interesting, so hopefully it will be to the Club.

[03/06/2024, 23:42:55] Hannah: OKAY this was a tricky one for me. Historically I have chosen albums that I’m excited by but not bothered if they’re good or not. But this band is one I’ve been following for a few years and been shouting about even to you lot. This is their second album and it came out last week. I hope it’s excellent and I hope you all get something out of it; not after a winning score (nothing can touch HAWXX) just maybe for Reliqa to have a few more fans in the mix…

I've deliberately gone for something a bit out there and different because I thought us all trying something new is more fun than trying to find something that we might all actually like.
Therefore I present for your consideration : PALEHELL by Paledusk.
A new-ish band from Fukuoka, Japan. They've started turning some heads supporting bands on their Japanese shows, and are coming over to play their first international shows at 2000trees. Chaotic electric metal. Enjoy.

And then we will kick off July with a golden disk from the rugged and dashing @447557445101!

As that'll be one full rotation of reviews. I will get off my arse and give you an idea of how they've done in the ranking. 

Truth be told I was trying to code a database/app to do it. To impress you all, that's why I've not yielded any data... However I lack the skills, so I'll just make a spreadsheet.

[25/07/2024, 17:06:57] Adam: We've done 9. We lost @447549364196 in the surf of living earlier on and like the great Captain Oates wandered deferred so we could carry on
[25/07/2024, 17:07:59] George: O captain! My captain!
[25/07/2024, 17:08:32] George: What I would suggest is a maybe a mosh club pint
[25/07/2024, 17:09:04] George: Instead of reviewing albums, we review all of our most recent life choices over alcohol
[25/07/2024, 17:12:20] Matthew Floyd: A summer recess sounds wise! August is fully blocked out, much of which with ear bleeding tunes in various fields. 

That said, forever happy to plough through the bleed for safe passage to the mosh club.

Lucy and I will be in London the second weekend of Aug for mosh pints.
[25/07/2024, 17:22:32] Al: A summer recess is a great idea and I also think a pint having would be magical
[25/07/2024, 17:24:20] Adam: What dates are those!
[25/07/2024, 17:24:23] Adam: I'd love that
[26/07/2024, 07:01:12] Matthew Floyd: 24-hour festival in a Romanian castle, club?

[01/08/2024, 17:10:02] Adam: Despite George being a hard nut and some spoilt ballots it appears a break is in order. 

I propose we do as the schools do and start a new term on September 2nd, starting with handsome, handsome @447557445101  

In the meanwhile, i'll tot albums and let people know if they have missed some, what they are :)

[13/11/2024, 18:03:55] CATHY: I'm so kvlt don't even worry about it
[13/11/2024, 18:06:50] George: Good evening lovely people! After discussions with the man the myth the legend, Mr Adam Willis, we’ve decided that I have more time currently on my hands to manage such an illustrious group of people giving up an album for peer review on a bi weekly basis. The plan is to continue from where we left off with the running order as follows:

Fin
Cathy
Adam
Pip
Luce
George
Matt
Hannah
Al
Sanchez (Disqualified)

I actually really enjoy this shit so I’ll be running a tight ship to keep the vibes going. As such they’ll be a cheeky a disqualification system where if you ignore 3 reviews then you’re banned from submitting an album yourself unless you have actual mitigating circumstances aka life happens. Currently only Sanchez is in my bad books… punishment pending 💀

If you wish to pass on this new round of mosh club, but want to stay around for the excellent display of music, please say  ✨

Christmas is scarily approaching rather quickly as well, and I’m conscious that we will all not give a shit about this as our festive drink of choice starts to be consumed in vast quantities. As such, if we’re all happy,  I suggest we crack on immediately with Fin’s album on Monday, giving us at least 2 albums to digest before the Prosecco gears up. If not, we can push back an extra week but that’ll be the last album of 2024 (no pressure). 

Thoughts? Poll below on the restart.
@447557445101, do you have something to give us…?
